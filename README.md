## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Fragment-code
   ```

2. **Navigate to specific modules:**
   Each folder contains its own README with detailed instructions and examples.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Most scripts include required dependencies at the top. Install as needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn requests
   ```

## üéØ Use Cases

This repository is ideal for:
- **Blog Development** - Ready-to-use snippets for content management
- **Data Analysis** - Economic, financial, and statistical analysis tools
- **Web Automation** - Scraping, API integration, and data collection
- **Learning** - Examples of library usage and best practices
- **Prototyping** - Quick implementations for testing ideas

## üìù Code Organization

Each script follows a consistent naming convention:
- `b0XXX_description.py` - where XXX is a sequential number
- Clear, descriptive filenames indicating functionality
- Self-contained examples with minimal dependencies

## üîó Quick Navigation

- [Library Examples](./1.Library/README.md) - Learn library usage patterns
- [Automation Scripts](./2.Action/README.md) - Ready-to-use automation tools
- [Data Modules](./3.Object/README.md) - Specialized data processing
- [Analysis Tools](./4.Analysis/README.md) - Statistical and ML implementations

## üìö Contributing

When adding new snippets:
1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Include clear documentation and comments
3. Add examples and usage instructions
4. Update the relevant folder README
